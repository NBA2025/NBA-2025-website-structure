    "text": "Introduction\nThe NBA is the primary tool for monitoring and reporting on the state of biodiversity in South Africa. It is prepared as part of the South African National Biodiversity Institute’s (SANBI) mandate to monitor and report regularly on the status of South Africa’s biodiversity, and is a collaborative effort from many institutions and individuals. The NBA focusses primarily on assessing biodiversity at the ecosystem and species level, with efforts being made to include genetic level assessments. Two headline indicators that are applied to both ecosystems and species are used in the NBA: threat status and protection level. The products of the NBA include seven technical reports, a technical synthesis report and several popular outputs.\nThe primary purpose of the NBA is to provide a highlevel summary of the state of South Africa’s biodiversity at regular points in time, with a strong focus on spatial information. Each NBA builds on decades of research and innovation by South African scientists, and makes that science available in a useful form to users both inside and outside of the biodiversity sector. As a body of work the NBA is not prescriptive; it presents important information that can be adopted by government and civil society in various decision making processes to support socio-economic imperatives, human wellbeing, and the best management and conservation of South Africa’s biodiversity.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Continued investment in managing and conserving biodiversity is essential so that jobs that depend on biodiversity can continue to increase. Jobs directly related to biodiversity total more than 418 000, and this is likely an underestimate. This level of employment is comparable to that of the mining sector. For every job dedicated to conserving biodiversity (e.g. in protected areas or conservation authorities), there are at least five other jobs that depend directly on biodiversity use. These jobs are in sectors such as fisheries, wildlife ranching, biodiversity-based tourism, traditional medicine and indigenous tea production."

While a range of plans are in place to ensure that fisheries are sustainable, better practices to rebuild stocks of priority species are needed, as well as reliable data and sufficient capacity for undertaking regular stock assessments."

This body of knowledge should be used as a basis for policy, planning and decision making regarding the wise use and conservation of our country’s biodiversity assets and the management and restoration of ecological infrastructure. The NBA is a tool not only for the environment sector, but for all sectors of government that share the responsibility for the sustainable development of our landscapes and seascapes, and is prepared as part of the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) mandate under the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (Act 10 of 2004).\nShonisani Munzhedzi\nSouth African National Biodiversity Institute - Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\nSouth Africa is a special country, with diverse cultures, remarkable geological wealth and exceptional biodiversity, much of which is unique to our nation. With this rich endowment comes the responsibility and challenge of ensuring our species and ecosystems are conserved and used sustainably to the benefit of all South Africans and future generations. This biodiversity wealth gives our people tangible benefits like food, clean water, medicine and materials; it supports agricultural and fisheries production, and helps protect us from natural hazards like floods and droughts; and it provides the basis of a vibrant tourism industry while offering natural spaces for recreational and cultural activities.\nBiodiversity is central to South Africa’s national objectives of addressing poverty, inequality and unemployment, and supports increased economic growth and improved service delivery for all its citizens. Examining biodiversity in the context of social and economic change shows us that investing in ecological infrastructure is as important as investing in built infrastructure, and safeguarding the delivery of services from ecosystems can support service delivery from all spheres of government.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
