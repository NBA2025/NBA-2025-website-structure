    "text": "I am proud to present South Africa’s National Biodiversity Assessment 2025, a product of high scientific calibre that summarises the state of our biodiversity by drawing on a broad foundation of information compiled by over a hundred authors. This body of knowledge should be used as a basis for policy, planning and decision making regarding the wise use and conservation of our country’s biodiversity assets and the management and restoration of ecological infrastructure. The NBA is a tool not only for the environment sector, but for all sectors of government that share the responsibility for the sustainable development of our landscapes and seascapes, and is prepared as part of the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) mandate under the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (Act 10 of 2004).\nShonisani Munzhedzi\nSouth African National Biodiversity Institute - Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\nSouth Africa is a special country, with diverse cultures, remarkable geological wealth and exceptional biodiversity, much of which is unique to our nation. With this rich endowment comes the responsibility and challenge of ensuring our species and ecosystems are conserved and used sustainably to the benefit of all South Africans and future generations. This biodiversity wealth gives our people tangible benefits like food, clean water, medicine and materials; it supports agricultural and fisheries production, and helps protect us from natural hazards like floods and droughts; and it provides the basis of a vibrant tourism industry while offering natural spaces for recreational and cultural activities.\nBiodiversity is central to South Africa’s national objectives of addressing poverty, inequality and unemployment, and supports increased economic growth and improved service delivery for all its citizens. Examining biodiversity in the context of social and economic change shows us that investing in ecological infrastructure is as important as investing in built infrastructure, and safeguarding the delivery of services from ecosystems can support service delivery from all spheres of government.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

In the NBA 2018, several new indicators have been developed to provide a more comprehensive picture of the state of ecosystems and species.\n\n\n3 Evaluation of genetic diversity brings new value to the NBA\nGenetic diversity enables species to evolve and adapt within an ever-changing environment. The development of potential genetic diversity indicators for national-level assessments and monitoring has added value to the NBA and South Africa’s international reporting commitments.\n\n\n4 Investment in strategic and collaborative biodiversity monitoring programmes is crucial to inform management and decision making and for biodiversity assessments\nInvestment in existing and future strategic and cooperative biodiversity monitoring programmes is essential to strengthen our ability to detect and report on trends, plan accordingly and manage effectively.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "1 Biodiversity provides jobs\nSouth Africa’s biodiversity provides substantial employment in a range of sectors (established but incomplete). Continued investment in managing and conserving biodiversity is essential so that jobs that depend on biodiversity can continue to increase.\n\n\n2 Healthy ecosystems are essential for water security\nRivers, wetlands and their catchment areas are crucial ecological infrastructure for water security, often complementing built infrastructure, but the benefits from some of these ecosystems are currently compromised by their poor ecological condition (well established). Water security can be improved through integrated management of natural resources in Strategic Water Source Areas as well as other key catchments, including protection and restoration in some cases.\n\n\n3 Water flowing into the sea provides multiple benefits to people\nFreshwater flowing from rivers through estuaries into the sea is not wasted, and is essential for coastal and marine food production, livelihoods, tourism and future climate change resilience (established but incomplete). Through appropriate management, South Africa can maintain the vital freshwater flows that reach the coast.\n\n\n4 Small high-value ecosystem types take up just 5% of South Africa’s territory, but provide disproportionate benefits to people\nCertain small ecosystem types function as crucial ecological infrastructure and, despite their small footprint, provide multiple benefits to society (established but incomplete). Managing, protecting and restoring these small, high-value.\n\n\n5 Benefits from fishing are at risk, including food and job security\nEstuarine and marine ecosystems provide South Africans with food and livelihoods by providing a basis for fishing – whether commercial, subsistence or recreational. Yet many fish stocks are overexploited and many fish species are threatened (well established). While a range of plans are in place to ensure that fisheries are sustainable, better practices to rebuild stocks of priority species are needed, as well as reliable data and sufficient capacity for undertaking regular stock assessments.\n\n\n6 Climate change is impacting on people and ecosystems; in spite of this, healthy ecosystems can help us adapt to climate change\nThe impacts of climate change are evident across all realms and within most species groups. Biodiversity provides resilience against the worst effects of climate change (established but incomplete). Restoring ecosystems and maintaining them in a good ecological condition means they are better able to support natural adaptation and mitigation processes, offering increased protection to human communities and reducing the economic burden of future climate disasters.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

The restoration and protection of estuaries and inland wetlands will secure essential benefits and deliver large return on investment.\n\n\n2 Coastal biodiversity assets, including beaches, are at risk\nSixty per cent of coastal ecosystem types are threatened – a result of the many pressures concentrated on the coast (well established). Judicious coastal development that avoids sensitive areas can minimise further damage, maintain ecological infrastructure and reduce climate risks.\n\n\n3 Protected areas: investment success in the ocean and on land\nProtected areas have expanded in the ocean and on land, and are a source of pride for South Africans (well established). Continued expansion will help to ensure biodiversity conservation, ecological sustainability and even more social and economic benefits from biodiversity.\n\n\n4 Protected areas: providing effective protection for many species\nSouth Africa’s protected areas are generally providing good protection for species, as shown by new protection level indicators for species (established but incomplete). The results provide important feedback for protected area expansion strategies and for protected area management.\n\n\n5 Freshwater fishes are the most threatened species group in South Africa\nFreshwater fishes are the most threatened of all species groups that have been fully assessed in South Africa, and half of South Africa’s freshwater fish species are found nowhere else in the world (established but incomplete). Effective management and conservation strategies to halt the decline and promote recovery of threatened fish species are needed, focussed on the rivers and catchments where these fish occur.\n\n\n6 Trends in threat status show rapid declines in some of South Africa’s species, especially freshwater species and butterflies\nChanges in species threat status over time were tracked for eight taxonomic groups using the IUCN Red List Index (RLI). Increased extinction risk is evident for most groups, but freshwater species and butterflies, in particular, show a steep decline (established but incomplete). For the RLI to be more comprehensive, repeat assessments are required for species in the marine and estuarine realms, and invertebrates in general.\n\n\n7 Areas where pressures are concentrated should be priorities for spatial planning\nThe spatial distribution of pressures on biodiversity across the landscape and seascape is uneven. Pressure hotspots, where many different pressures converge, require strategic spatial planning and focussed management (established but incomplete).\n\n\n8 Biological invasions threaten biodiversity and human wellbeing\nOver 100 alien species have a severe impact on South Africa’s biodiversity and, in some cases, on human wellbeing (well established). Although some successes in the management of biological invasions have been achieved, the adoption of a national strategy for managing biological invasions, improved project-level planning for prevention and management, and enhanced spatially explicit data will greatly increase effectiveness of current efforts.\n\n\n9 Cooperative governance is essential for healthy landscapes and seascapes\nBiodiversity patterns and ecological processes are connected in complex ways that cross realms as well as human-constructed boundaries. At the same time, human activities in a range of different sectors that have separate policies and legislation and are separately managed, can impact on the same biodiversity or ecological infrastructure (established but incomplete). To deal with this interconnectedness, cooperative governance and cross-sectoral planning and decision making are essential.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Introduction\nThe NBA is the primary tool for monitoring and reporting on the state of biodiversity in South Africa. It is prepared as part of the South African National Biodiversity Institute’s (SANBI) mandate to monitor and report regularly on the status of South Africa’s biodiversity, and is a collaborative effort from many institutions and individuals. The NBA focusses primarily on assessing biodiversity at the ecosystem and species level, with efforts being made to include genetic level assessments. Two headline indicators that are applied to both ecosystems and species are used in the NBA: threat status and protection level. The products of the NBA include seven technical reports, a technical synthesis report and several popular outputs.\nThe primary purpose of the NBA is to provide a highlevel summary of the state of South Africa’s biodiversity at regular points in time, with a strong focus on spatial information. Each NBA builds on decades of research and innovation by South African scientists, and makes that science available in a useful form to users both inside and outside of the biodiversity sector. As a body of work the NBA is not prescriptive; it presents important information that can be adopted by government and civil society in various decision making processes to support socio-economic imperatives, human wellbeing, and the best management and conservation of South Africa’s biodiversity.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
